    </h3>
    <p>Dual H-Bridge on usual Arduino adaptor.<br>
      <br>

      Note DuplicateOutput class for helping to run the enables or the
      bridges in parallel.</p>
    <p>Motor voltage must be at least 2.5V greater than logic voltage,
      7.5 for 5V logic, but also 7V minimum.<br>
      Maximum motor voltage is 46 V.<br>
      Maximum load per channel is 2A DC, perhaps 2.5 A if pulses leave
      enough off time, 3A for 100uS pulses.<br>
      You may successfully tie the two together for double the capacity.</p>
    <p>External clamp diodes are suggested for any inductive load, such
      as all motors.</p>
    <p>It can pull 70ma from the logic supply when an output is on,
      typically 50.<br>
      It still takes 5..10ma when drivers are off.</p>
    <p>Logic thresholds are 1.5V and 2.3V regardless of supply voltage,
      at -10/100 uA load.<br>
      Nearly 2V and possible 5V are lost in the H-bridge! For a 12V load
      consider using a 15V supply.<br>
      The sense resistor will be fed 2V.</p>
    <p>Don't expect more than 25kHz performance, although you might be
      able to push to 40kHz with some loads.</p>
    <p>Enable is active high, pull that sucker down with a resistor else
      the load might move during processor reset and download.<br>
      The other 2 controls are "one way", "the other", and if both
      "don't move". When disabled expect the motor to slow down and stop
      due to pushing some current through the part, but preferably
      through external diodes.</p>
    <p>Multiwatt15 package is used, mounted on a heat sink.</p>
    <p>Freestanding WB291111:</p>
    <p>It is essential to not use the pullups when you are using 3.3V
      logic to drive the board.</p>
    <p>I do not use the pullups so that I can access 5V VCC from the
      jumpers for them.<br>
      I soldered the connection for CS1 to its ground, jumpered CS2 to
      CS1 and then used the CS2 ground for the GND to pair with the 5V
      accessed via U1 jumper. <br>
      Pullups are not a particularly good choice for this device,
      pulldowns would have made more sense when attached to a logic
      source as that is the inactive level for all signals. <br>
      The pullups should only be used when controlling the board from
      simple contacts or open-collector drivers.</p>

    <h3>L293</h3>
    <br>
    L293 Arduino boards use a more flexible component, which has enough
    extra control lines that the interface is SPI-ish, via an HC595
    shift register with output register.<br>
    The controls are shifted out a pin with a clock, then a clock is
    pulsed for the output register. There are 4 half-H direction
    controls, and two enables each enable going to a pair of half-H's.<br>
    <br>
    For bidirectional DC motor use one provides a direction and its
    complement to the pair of half-H's that share an enable.<br>
    When driving 4 independent coils you will most likely not manipulate
    the enables other than as a system shutdown state.<br>
    <br>
    The Adafruit 1.x, DK boards have two L293D's:<br>

    <p> Use a DRV8871 or DRV8833 board when ever possible instead of
      L29x boards, they waste a lot less power and don't lose nearly as
      much voltage (typically).</p>
