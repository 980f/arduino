# 980f's arduino utilties

This is a curated import from other 980f git repos: ezcpp, and dro/arduino.

It uses 980f/ezcpp as is, which the developer clones below this repo like is common for submodules, but doesn't actually declare it to be a submodule.

IE if you find missing files then:
cd <your arduino install>/libraries/980f
git clone https://github.com/980f/ezcpp.git
