#To get arduino 2.0 able to use the ESP32-C3 usb ttyACM* port I had to modify the priveleges on the dynamically generated /dev/ttyACM0 port.
#I grepped /lib/udev/rules.d until I found where dialout was set, then duplicated that line in my own file replacing setting the GROUP with setting the MODE.
#KERNEL=="tty[A-Z]*[0-9]|ttymxc[0-9]*|pppox[0-9]*|ircomm[0-9]*|noz[0-9]*|rfcomm[0-9]*", GROUP="dialout"
KERNEL=="tty[A-Z]*[0-9]|ttymxc[0-9]*|pppox[0-9]*|ircomm[0-9]*|noz[0-9]*|rfcomm[0-9]*",  MODE="0666"

#I note that as written only 10 ttyACM* devices can be created, looks like a bug to me.
