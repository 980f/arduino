## run this from your newly created sketch directory to make it convenient to link to the shared code.

#arduous does the painful thing needed to share code that isn't in a formal arduino library:
ln -sf ../shared/arduous .

#use this to make a list of your links, usually routed to a file for making a zip.
ln -sf ../shared/lardls

#a handy link, I got tired of typing ../shared when trying to autocomplete making a library link
ln -sf ../shared lib

#some of the above scripts append to .gitignore, which produces an ignorable warning if it doesn't exist so:
if [ ! -e .gitignore ]; then touch .gitignore ; fi
