arduino library management

For folders:
arduino-install/libraries,
$HOME/.arduino15/packages/esp32/hardware/esp32/2.0.2/libraries,
sketchbook/libraries

look for "library.properties"
within each such folder's /src count the header files, if none then not a library.
for each library.properties file check for 'sentence'

libs are scanned 16 times!

--

Include library brings in all header files in no particular order, even if some are just used internally by the cpp files.
To drop those we would have to discover whether there is a filter point not documented.
