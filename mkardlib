# the rest of this file is documentation
# you must put all of the shared code in its own source files, the ino should be the minimal setup() and loop() that you can live with.
# put your top level code into yourclass.setup() and yourclass.loop() for easy discovery.
# it is ok for your setup() and loop() to have some arguments, ones that will be described in your example.ino

#zip file layout: first folder is the library name
#zip should execute from libraries and stored paths should be relative to libraries.

#instead of a zipfile one can make a git repo and git clone it to a directory named for the lib. When prompted by library manager for a zipfile give the path to the git clone root.
#
# instruction to give to users:
# place zip on your system where you can find it.
# start arduino with either no sketch or the sketch to which you wish to add the module
# from menu: Sketch/Include Library/Add .ZIP library
# then you can browse <your sketchbook>/libraries/thislibrary/examples for a sample sketch to pull from 
# or if you haven't started a sketch (you have the date-named one) File/Examples/<lib name>/<lib name>
